# myshell
A minimal POSIX-compatible and simple shell implementation in C, designed as a learning project to understand the fundamentals of shell programming and system calls.

## Overview

minishell is a minimalistic shell implementation that demonstrates core shell functionalities including:

- Command execution
- Basic built-in commands
- Process management
- Input/output redirection
- Pipeline support
- Signal handling

## Features (Planned)

- [x] Basic command execution
- [x] Built-in commands (cd, pwd, exit, printenv, print_history)
- [x] Environment variable support (shell variable assignment and retrieval)
- [x] Command history with up/down arrow keys
- [ ] Input/output redirection (>, <, >>)
- [ ] Pipeline support (|)
- [ ] Background process execution (&)
- [ ] Signal handling (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z)
- [ ] Tab completion

## Building
